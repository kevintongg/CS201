Part 1:  Short Answers, 4 points each
1.	-2 (static methods) D only
2c) Why does main take that particular data type as a parameter?
better answer: because Strings can be parsed to many other data types and we may need any number of input values 
4a) if(x == 3.14159) System.out.println("x = PI!");
-1 should not test doubles for equality using ==
 c) 
public static String[] getStringArrayFromInput(int n) {
String[] theArray = new String[n];
for (int counter = 1; counter < n; counter++)
		theArray[counter] = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,
		"Please enter a String value");		
return theArray;
}

Missed first value in array

d) 
public static int getIntArrayFromInput(int count) {
	int[] theArray = new int[count];
	for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
		theArray = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Please enter an integer value"));	
	}
return theArray;
}

clearer answer: method should return an int but returns an array of ints.  Also, tries to assign an int value to an array of ints.

6. Why does Java use "pass reference by value" instead of plain "pass by value" to pass arrays to methods as parameters and to return arrays from methods? 
better answer: since an array might have any size, it might be very expensive to copy it. 

7.  Mooseville... -4
l = (m + 5) * -2;


9. Suppose you have a two-dimensional array called myArray.  What are the indices of the element in the third row,
fifth column?  Be sure to list the indices in the correct order.  

-4 IMPORTANT! myArray[2][4] 

part 3:
-5
	public static void show32BitCount(long[] longArray){
		int intCount = 0;
		for(long l : longArray)	if(l >= -2147483648 && l <= 2147483647) intCount++;			
		System.out.println("Array contains " + longArray.length + " values, of which " + intCount +" are within the range of the Java int type");
		
	}
