  <h3>Part A, 24 points: due at the end of the second class meeting</h3>
  Answer the following questions in one to four sentences each. You may consult the lecture notes or
  textbook.
  Do not copy any text; write the answers in your own words.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Why do programmers need to carefully consider data types like int and double?
    </li>
    <li>
      Assembly language gives programmers maximum control over the details of computer programs and
      thus
      usually produces code that uses resources and time very efficiently. Why do we usually use
      high
      level languages instead of assembly?
    </li>
    <li>
      Most programming languages are either compiled or interpreted, but Java uses a two-step
      process
      in which source code is compiled to bytecode, which is interpreted at runtime. What is the
      benefit
      of this process?
    </li>
    <li>
      Suppose you compile and run the class MyClass at the command line. The file name will be
      MyClass.java.
      <br/>
      a) What does the command javac MyClass.java do?
      <br/>
      a) What does the command java MyClass do?
    </li>
    <li>
      Why doesn't the programmer have to decide which specific transistors to use to store data or
      which program can access a CPU at a particular time?
    </li>
    <li>
      Suppose you have already paid for your computer. Why do we still say that CPU time or memory
      is <em>expensive?</em>
    </li>

  </ol>

  <h3>Part B, 60 points: due at the end of the first class meeting of Week 2</h3>

  <p>
    Write a Java program that does the following:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Includes a one-line comment that states your name
    </li>
    <li>
      Includes a multi-line comment with the name of the course and the purpose of the program, for
      example:
      <pre>
		        /* CS201
		         * Spring 2014
		         * Lab 1 Solution
		         */
		    </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Sets up an int variable called age and sets it to your age in years (I don't care whether you
      tell
      the truth about this!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Sets up a double variable and sets it to your GPA (I don't care if you tell the truth about
      this, either!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Prints out your name, the value of age, and the value of your GPA variable, with some
      reasonable text in between,
      eg:
      <br/>
      John is 31 and has a GPA of 3.975
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn in the .java file containing the code <strong>on CSNS.</strong> There is no need to
      submit the .class file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Part C, 16 points: Due before the second class meeting of Week 2</h3>
  <p>
    Run your program from Part I <strong>on the computer you will be using for homework:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Get the JDK and install it
    </li>
    <li>
      Run the program from part I
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn in <strong>on CSNS </strong> a screen shot of the output *from your homework computer*
    </li>
  </ul>
