<br/>
Turn in just your .java file on CSNS. Do not use any form of file compression.</h4>
<p>
	Write a Java program that does the following tasks and, in each case, outputs the results in
	a reasonable format, eg:
	<br/>
	The volume of a sphere of radius 2 is 33.51032
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Declares an int with value 42 and casts it to a double
	</li>
	<li>
		Declares a double variable with the value 49.9 and casts it to an int
	</li>
	<li>
		Declares an int variable with the value -2147483647, then subtracts 1. Ouput the value both
		before and after the addition.
	</li>

	<li>
		Declares an int variable with the value -2147483648, prints out the value, then subtracts 1 and prints out the
		value,
		then subtracts 1 again and prints out the value.
	</li>
	<li>
		Calculates the volume of a sphere this way:

		<ul>
			<li>
				Declares a final double called PI with the value 3.1416
			</li>
			<li>
				Declares an int variable called radius and sets its value to 5
			</li>
			<li>
				Uses the formula
				V = 4/3 PI radius <sup>3</sup> to calculate the volume. Show the result to
				exactly three digits past the decimal point.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Converts your height in inches to your height in centimeters this way:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Creates a final double called INCHESTOCM and sets its value to the appropriate conversion
				constant, which is 2.54.
			</li>
			<li>
				Creates a variable of type double and sets its value to your height in inches. I do not care whether you
				tell the truth about this.
			</li>
			<li>
				Calculates and outputs your height in cm. Use the formula CM = inches * INCHESTOCM.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Uses the formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9 to convert the following values from Fahrenheit to Celsius: -40, 0, and 212
	</li>

	<li>
		Tests two values for divisibility by 7 this way:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Creates an int variable, sets its value to 111, and uses modulo to determine whether the value is evenly
				divisible by 7
			</li>
			<li>
				Assigns the new value 112 to the int variable, and uses modulo to determine whether the value is evenly
				divisible by 7
			</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Determines and outputs whether it is true that 1 + 2 is less than 10 but false that 5 > 7
	</li>
	<li>
		Declares variables of the appropriate types and sets them to your age in years and GPA
		(no need to tell the truth) and determines whether
		<ul>
			<li>
				a) either your age is greater than 25
				or your GPA is greater than 3.0
			</li>
			<li>
				b) your age is greater than 25 *and*
				your GPA is also greater than 3.0.
			</li>
		</ul>
		In each case, write code that evaluates the expression and sets the value of a boolean variable
		to the result, then print the value of the variable.
	</li>
</ol>
