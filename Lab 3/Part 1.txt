Part I: Short Answers, 5 points each 
Due at the end of the first lab period in week 4. Turn in a plain text file on CSNS.

1. Consider the following code, which calculates the charge for ordering an item in a restaurant.
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
double totalCost = 0d;
System.out.println("Please enter 'S' to order a salad, 'M' for a Martini, or 'F' for a filet mignon");
char choice = sc.next().charAt(0);
switch(choice){
	case 'S':
		totalCost += 3.75;
	case 'M':
		totalCost += 6.50;
	case 'F':
		totalCost += 35.00;
}
		
a) What will the customer be charged if he orders only a filet mignon? 
	35.00
b) What will the customer be charged if orders only a salad? 
	45.25
c) How could we make this code work correctly?
	add break; to every case

	e.g.

	switch(choice){
	case 'S':
		totalCost += 3.75;
		break;
	case 'M':
		totalCost += 6.50;
		break;
	case 'F':
		totalCost += 35.00;
		break;
}

2. Consider this statement: 
System.out.println(godzillaApproaching?"run for the hills!":"carry on as usual"); 
a) What does the statement do? 
	This statement prints the the data stored in the variable godzillaApproaching with the ternary operator ?: which translates to if-then-else (shorthand).
	(If Godzilla is approaching, run for the hills. If not (else), carry on as usual.)
b) What is the data type of the variable godzillaApproaching?
	String

3. The final Math.PI will supply the value of pi. Use printf to print the value of some integer radius (for example, 5), the value of Math.PI, and the circumference of a circle of the stated radius. Show the last two values to exactly four places past the decimal point.
	{
		int radius = 5;
		double pi = Math.PI;
		double circumference = ((radius * 2)* Math.PI);
		System.out.printf("radius = %d\n%s = %.4f\ncircumference = %.4f\n",radius,"\u03c0",pi,circumference);
	}

	(\u03c0 = pi (Ï€) in source)

4. Suppose that the value of x % y is 1. Can we tell whether x is evenly divisible by y? If so, is it? Can we tell whether y is evenly divisible by x? If so, is it?
	Yes, we can. No, x is not evenly divisible by y. We can tell if y is evenly divisible by x. No, y is not evenly divisible by x because due to the fact that we had x % y = 1, we can assume x was a bigger integer than y was (e.g. 7 = x 6 = y; 7 % 6 = 1, but 6 % 7 returns a remainder (a decimal) which is not 0. And if the remainder was 0, we could say that it is even divisible). If the answer/remainder results to 0, it is evenly divisible.

5. Consider the following truth table:
a	b	Value
f	f	f
f	t	f
t	f	f
t	t	t 

What Java logical operator corresponds to this truth table?
	The && operator.
