    Consider the following code, which calculates the charge for ordering an item in a restaurant.
    <pre>
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
double totalCost = 0d;
System.out.println("Please enter 'S' to order a salad, 'M' for a Martini, or 'F' for a filet mignon");
char choice = sc.next().charAt(0);
switch(choice){
	case 'S':
		totalCost += 3.75;
	case 'M':
		totalCost += 6.50;
	case 'F':
		totalCost += 35.00;
}
		</pre>
    a) What will the customer be charged if he orders only a filet mignon?
    <br/>
    b) What will the customer be charged if orders only a salad?
    <br/>
    c) How could we make this code work correctly?
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider this statement:
    <br/>
    System.out.println(godzillaApproaching?"run for the hills!":"carry on as usual");
    <br/>
    a) What does the statement do?
    <br/>
    b) What is the data type of the variable godzillaApproaching?
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    The final Math.PI will supply the value of pi. Use printf to print the value of some
    integer radius (for example, 5), the value of Math.PI, and the circumference
    of a circle of the stated radius. Show the last two values to exactly four places past the
    decimal point.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    Suppose that the value of x % y is 1. Can we tell whether x is evenly divisible by y? If so, is
    it? Can we tell
    whether y is evenly divisible by x? If so, is it?
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the following truth table:
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>a</th>
        <th>b</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>f</td>
        <td>f</td>
        <td>f</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>f</td>
        <td>t</td>
        <td>f</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>t</td>
        <td>f</td>
        <td>f</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>t</td>
        <td>t</td>
        <td>t</td>
      </tr>

<h4>Part II: Programming Assignment, 75 points</h4>

<p>
  Write a Java program that does the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Prompts the user for the following information and stores the input in appropriate variables:
  <li>
    Whether the user is left-handed
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the user's father was less than 5 ft 8 inches tall
  </li>
  <li>
    The user's age in months
  </li>
  <li>
    The name of a sibling or friend of the user
  </li>
  <li>
    The age in months of the sibling or friend
  </li>
  <li>
    The user's GPA
  </li>
  <li>
    The displacement in liters of the user's car engine
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
  Prints out the following information, using System.out.println() for the output:
  <ul>
    <li>
      a) Whether the user is left-handed
    </li>

    <li>
      b) Whether the user's father was less than 5 ft 8 inches tall
    </li>
    <li>
      c) Whether at least one of the values from a and b are true (true if either or both are true)
    </li>
    <li>
      d) Whether a and b are both true (false if at least one is false)
    </li>
    <li>
      e) Whether the truth values of a and b are the same (true if both a and b are true or if
      both a and b are false)
    </li>
    <li>
      f) Whether the user is older than his/her sibling/friend (as far as we can tell from the ages
      in months.) Show the
      sibling or friend's name in the output (eg, "Sally is older than you!"
    </li>
    <li>
      g) Whether the user's age in months is within 18 months of the age of the sibling/friend.
      You may want to use Math.abs(), which computes the absolute value of a number, for this.
    </li>
    <li>
      h) Whether the user's age in months is evenly divisible by 6
    </li>

    <li>
      i) Whether the user's GPA is at least equal to the displacement in liters of his/her car
      engine
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
