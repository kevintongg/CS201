<h2>CS 201 Lab 4 </h2>
<h3>Part I: Due at the end of the first lab period of week 5</h3>
<p>
	5 points each
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Consider this code and output:
		<pre>
double a = 3.30;
double b = 1.59;
double c = a / b;
double d = c * b;
System.out.println(a == d);
            </pre>
		output:
		<pre>
false
            </pre>
		Why does this code produce the output shown?
		<p/>
	</li>
	<li>
		What will these code snippets do?
		<br/>
		a)
		<pre>
while(counter <= 100);{
    System.out.println(counter);
    counter++;
}                                   
            </pre>
		b)
		<pre>
for(int counter = 0; counter < 100; counter++){
    System.out.println(counter);
    counter--;
}       
            </pre>
		<p/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Consider this code:

		<pre>
		boolean betterExists = false;
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		do {
			System.out
					.println("Is there a better class than CS201? Enter y or n\n");
			if (sc.next().equals("n"))
				betterExists = false;
			else
				betterExists = true;
		} while (betterExists);
		System.out.println("You got it right!");
</pre>
		Invalid input (like "maybe" or "42") causes the loop to run again, rather than crash. How does this work?
	</li>
	<li>
		What does this code do?
		<pre>
for(int counter = 1; counter <= 100; counter++){
    System.out.println(counter + ": " + (counter % 7 == 0?"true":"false"));          
}        
    </pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Answer the question below in one well-constructed paragraph. A well-constructed paragraph has an introductory
		sentence that states the general point, several sentences that offer examples or arguments, and a concluding
		sentence that sums
		up the paragraph.

			Why do we use computer programs to control dishwashers but pay human beings to design dishwashers?

<h3>Part II, Check CSNS for due date</h3>

<p>
	Write a program that calculates the effect that various possible grades in CS201 will have on the user's GPA
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Use Console input to ask the user for his or her present GPA and the number of total units
		he or she has taken. Cast these to a Double and an Integer.
	</li>
	<li>
		For each of the above variables, ask the user repeatedly until s/he enters reasonable values. A GPA cannot be
		greater than 4.0 nor less than 0.0,
		and the number of units completed can't be less than 0. However, it is OK
		if the program breaks when the user enters input that cannot be parsed to the numeric types (for example, if user
		inputs
		age a).
	</li>
	<li>
		For simplicity, you may assume the user is not taking any other classes this term. If you want an extra challenge,
		you may figure out on your own how to account for other classes taken this term.
	</li>
	<li>
		Note that CS201 is a 5 unit class. Use a variable or constant for this value so that you could easily change it if
		you wanted to
		apply this program to another class.
	</li>
	<li>
		The new GPA is calculated this way: ((present GPA * existing units) + (new units * grade)) / (existing units + new
		units)
	</li>
	<li>
		Use a loop to find the effect on the student's GPA for each possible grade from A to C. An A grade corresponds
		to 4 grade points, an A- corresponds to 3.7, B+ is worth 3.3, etc. Use a while or do...while loop with a separate
		group of if statments
		that decrements the grade by 0.3 if it was 4.0, 3.3, 3.0, or 2.3 or decrements it by 0.4 if it was 3.7 or 2.7.
	</li>
	<li>
		You will need to use Math.abs() in the loop test. Due to the imprecision of floating point types,
		you will not get correct results if you simply test whether a grade is, for example, equal to 3.0.
		See lecture 5.
	</li>
	<li>
		Think carefully about the test in the while or do...while loop. The loop should break after the output is shown for
		a grade of 2.0.
	</li>
	<li>
		For each possible grade, show the grade, the new GPA, and the change between the old and new GPAs.
	</li>
</ol>
