  Write a Java class that performs the user's choice of geometric calculations. You may use either
  console or JOptionPane I/O, but do not mix them.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Write a method that takes three parameters, namely one String and two doubles. The method
        should generate
        a prompt based on the String and require the user to enter a double value that is no less
        than the
        first double and no larger than the second. For example, if the method is called with
        parameters
        "radius", 0.0 and 100.5, the prompt will say "Please enter a value between 0.0 and 100.5 for
        the radius." Do not use if statements or other conditionals to match specific possible
        Strings; instead, use the String parameter in the prompt.
      <p>
        Use a while or do...while loop to ask the user repeatedly until s/he enters a value within
        the
        correct range. If the user enters a value outside the range, provide an error message
        explaining the problem.
        If you use Console I/O, validate for the data type; if you use JOptionPane,
        it is OK if the application crashes on input that cannot be parsed to double. When the user
        enters valid input, the method should return the value entered. Use this method to get
        whatever input is required from the user for each type of calculation in the other methods
        listed
        below.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      In main(), prompt the user to choose one of the following: quit, calculate the area
      of a triangle, calculate the volume of a sphere, or calculate the volume of a cylinder.
      Get the user's choice and use a switch statement to call the appropriate method
      for the operation the user chooses. This prompt must be inside a loop that will terminate when
      the user chooses to quit. The user will be able to make as many calculations as s/he chooses,
      continuing until he or she choose to quit.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use a separate method for each type of calculation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return the result of each calculation to main, and display it. Do not do any output in the
      calculation methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep track of the largest triangle, largest sphere, and largest cylinder seen so far. When the
      program
      terminates, show the size of the largest example of each type.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use these formulas:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Area of a triangle: 1/2 * base * height
        </li>
        <li>
          Volume of a sphere: 4/3 &pi; r<sup>3</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          Volume of a cylinder: &pi; r<sup>2</sup> * height
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a final that is accessible anywhere in the class for PI. Limit all variables to the most
      restrictive scope
      that
      will work.
    </li>

  </ul>
