<h2>CS 201 Lab 7
  <br/>
  Due Wednesday of week 9 before class</h2>
<p>
  Write a Java class with methods that perform various operations on an array of doubles.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Write a method that creates an array of ten doubles, initializes it with ten values taken from
    input, and returns a
    reference to the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a method that uses Math.pow() to raise 3 to the power of each value in an array of doubles
    and
    shows each result. This method should not change the values in the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a method that replaces any value exceeding 100 in an array of doubles with the value 100.
    This
    method should be void; in other words it should not return anything. Be sure you understand how
    array references are
    sent to methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a method that copies an array of doubles, replaces each value with its reciprocal (that
    is, replaces x with
    1/x)
    and returns the new array. Be sure you understand the
    difference between copying an array and copying an array reference, or you will
    not do this part correctly.
  </li>
  <li>Write a method that prints out all the values in an array of doubles</li>
  <li>
    main() should call the input method, then send the array to the print method, then run each of
    the
    other methods, using the print method to print the current values after each method is done.
    After
    running the method that creates a new array, print out <strong>both </strong>
    the original array and the one returned by the method.
  </li>
</ul>
