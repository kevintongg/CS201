Program is to simulate a game of Rock Paper Scissors with input taken from user for the sign they want.

You can first assign the values of rock, paper, scissors to 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

We can also use switch/case statements to create this game.

We can assume this game will run indefinitely until the user decides to stop.

PROGRAM: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

initialize a Scanner with a Scanner variable for console input

initialize an int with a variable name of "choice" and a value of 0

initialize a do... while loop
do
  ask input from user for what choice they want:
    0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors

  randomize a choice from the computer/AI:
    randomize a choice: 0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors

  assign input to choice
    choice equals to name of scanner next integer

  switch choice statement with breaks
  case 1:
    if user picked 0 for rock
      if computer randomized 0 for rock
        print "it is a draw."
      else if computer randomized 1 for paper
        print "sorry, you lost."
      else if computer randomized 2 for scissors
        print "congratulations! you won!"
    insert break;

  case 2:
    if user picked 1 for paper
      if computer randomized 1 for paper
        print "it is a draw."
      else if computer randomized 2 for scissors
        print "sorry, you lost."
      else if computer randomized 0 for rock
        print "congratulations! you won!"
    insert break;

  case 3:
    if user picked 2 for scissors
      if computer randomized 2 for scissors
        print "it is a draw."
      else if computer randomized 0 for rock
        print "sorry, you lost."
      else if computer randomized 1 for paper
        print "congratulations! you won!"
    insert break;

  to make sure user enters valid input for the range of 0 to 2
  if pick is not between 0 to 2
    print "invalid input, try again."

while user choice does not equal 0, the loop ends and thus the game ends
