<h2>CS 201 Lab 8</h2>
<h3>Part I: due at the end of the first lab period in Week 10</h3>
<p>
  1a, 15 points. Implement the "bizzbuzz" pseudocode from lecture 13 in a Java application
</p>
<p>
  1b, 15 points. Write pseudocode for the game of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors"> "Rock,
  Paper, Scissors"</a>
</p>
<h3> Part II, 70 points, check CSNS for due date</h3>
<p>
  Write a Java application that implements a two-player game of Tic Tac Toe.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use a two-dimensional array of chars to represent the board. Use blanks rather than null
    values to represent unoccupied squares. You can create the board as follows (note that there are
    blanks between
    the single quotes, even though this may not be clear in your browser): <br/>
    char [][] board ={{'&nbsp;','&nbsp;','&nbsp;'},{'&nbsp;','&nbsp;','&nbsp;'},{'&nbsp;','&nbsp;','&nbsp;'}};
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a variable whose data type is an enum to keep track of which player should move next. The
    possible values for the enum are "O" and "X". Each time a player moves, toggle the value of the
    variable to indicate that the turn has changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    For each move, show the current state of the board, indicate whose turn it is, and ask for the
    next move. You may use either Console or JOptionPane I/O, but do not mix them. There are various
    reasonable formats for the input, but one possibility is to ask separately for the row and
    column of
    the square the user wants to occupy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the user input to update the board. Do not allow moves to squares that are already occupied.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>This is the hard part.</strong> After each move, run a method that determines whether or
    not
    a player has won the game. Consider all eight possible ways to win. If a player has won, provide
    output
    that indicates the victor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hard</strong> extra credit: write and use a method that automatically determines the
    moves for
    one player, so that a single player can play against the computer. This will involve making a
    deep
    copy of the board and considering the effect of hypothetical moves. The first thing to consider
    is whether
    any available move will result in immediate vicory; if so, make that move. If not, consider
    whether the
    opponent has a winning move available at his next turn; if so, block it by occupying that
    square. You
    should think out the rest of the strategy from this point.
  </li>
</ul>
